      <div class="question">
        <div class="q">Q. When is the event held?</div>
        <div class="a">
          <p>A. The photo contest is held every month as a way to encourage photographers of all levels to continuously challenge themselves and improve their craft. By offering a new theme or prompt each month, participants are given a chance to experiment with different subjects and techniques, and to push their creativity to new heights.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <div class="q">Q. Can i only have 1 vote?</div>
        <div class="a">
          <p>A. No, you can vote for more than one entries. Allowing voters to choose more than one entry in a photo contest helps to promote a more inclusive and diverse voting process. By allowing voters to vote for multiple entries, it ensures that participants who may have multiple strong submissions are not unfairly disadvantaged by being limited to only one vote.</p>

      <div class="question">
        <div class="q">Q. Would I see my rankings after the award?</div>

          <p>
            A. No, there is no ranking in this contest. Winners of the contest
            will be announced. The contest winners will be chosen based on their individual merits, without being assigned any specific numerical or ranked value.
