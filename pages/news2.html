          It emphasizes composition: Without the distraction of color, black and white photography puts more emphasis on the composition of the image. You'll need to pay closer attention to the lines, shapes, and textures in the scene to create a visually striking image.

          It's great for low-light situations: Black and white photography is often a better choice than color in low-light situations. This is because it can create a better contrast between the dark and light areas of the image, making it easier to see the details.
